# Customer_behavior_analysis
The Customer Behavior Analysis project explores customer purchase patterns using Python and PostgreSQL. It analyzes demographics, spending habits, and shipping preferences to identify key trends. Insights help optimize marketing, boost sales, and improve customer retention through data-driven decisions.

# Overview
The Customer Behavior Analysis project focuses on understanding customer purchase patterns, preferences, and spending behavior through data analytics. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and interactive dashboard creation using Power BI. The insights help identify key trends, optimize marketing strategies, and improve decision-making.

# Dataset
Source: Customer transactions and demographic data (CSV format)
Attributes include: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Region, Product Category, Purchase Amount, Payment Method, Shipping Type (Standard / Express), Purchase Date.

# Tools & Technologies
Python: Data loading, cleaning, and EDA (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
SQL: Data querying and transformation using PostgreSQL
Power BI: Dashboard and data visualization
Gamma App(AI): For creating a professional presentation (PPT report)

# Project Steps
Data Loading: Import the dataset into Python using pandas.
Data Cleaning: Handle nulls, outliers, and inconsistencies.
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Analyze purchase trends, spending by demographics, and sales performance.
Visualize insights using charts and graphs.
SQL Integration: Store and query data in a PostgreSQL Server database. Run analytical SQL queries to extract insights.
Dashboard Creation: Connect cleaned data to Power BI.Build interactive dashboards showing KPIs and customer insights.
Report & Presentation: Summarize findings in a report.
Design a presentation using Gamma to showcase key outcomes.
